## OpenCV_Python_Create_Face_Annotation_Tool
Create a bounding box around a face present in the input image and save the cropped face automatically.

Place all the files in the same folder and run the .py file, example:
python submission.py

# How does it work?

1) Right click on the first point of the area you want to cut.
2) Drag the mouse (without releasing the button) to another point to complete the zone.
2) Release the right mouse button.

# The result will be

1) The selected image area with a square in the window.
